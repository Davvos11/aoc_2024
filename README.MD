# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Written in Rust.

Put puzzles and examples in the `puzzles` folder.  

## Usage
To run all days:
```shell
cargo run --release --
```
To run latest day:
```shell
cargo run --release -- --latest
```
To run day x:
```shell
cargo run --release -- x
```
Additionally, you can provide `--debug` to only run the examples
of a day and skip running the full input.
